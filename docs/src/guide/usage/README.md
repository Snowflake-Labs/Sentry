# Usage

## Streamlit application

The queries that Sentry provides are separated into Streamlit pages. Each page
contains a set of queries with more details on each query collapsed in an
expander:

![Main page screenshot annotated](../../assets/main_page_annotated_light.png
"Main page screenshot annotated")

The details typically contain SQL text of the query and in some cases some
additional information.
